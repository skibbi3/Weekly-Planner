# Weekly tracker
## Opportunity
In teams that have twice weekly stand-ups (one on Monday and one on Friday) a common reporting structure is the priorities for the week and then reflections on the week. It can be hard to keep track of these priorities as one's responsibilities increase and looking back on previous weeks for future reference can be very difficult when based only on memory.

## Solution
A tool for keeping track of weekly priorities, their status, wins, and reflections on the week. These weekly reports are to be accessible at any time.

## Features
* As a user, I want to track my weekly priorities, so that I can plan my actions around them.
* As a user, I want to track progress against my priorities, so that I know if I need to adjust course.
* As a user, I want to track my reflections, so that I can remember how the week went.
* As a user, I want to export reports, so that I can share them in a more readable format.

## Technical considerations
Can be run locally without cloud hosting. Should be stand-alone and not need any additional software installed.
